            <h3 id="headline">Aristotle's key beliefs:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Everything in this life has a purpose.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>living thing abides by the same rules.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>its life till its death, everything has the potential/purpose for perfection.</strong>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Biology</h3>
            <p>He believed that all humans originated from the sea and that complex life came from a gradual
                development of less-complex life forms. This hypothesis would later be proven true by
                Charles Darwin and a huge number of biological
                observations and experiments</p>

            <h3>Axioms</h3>
            <p>Aristotle believed that when trying to determine the fundamental nature of reality, the only place to
                begin was with basic axioms. He established the axioms of non-contradiction which stated that a if
                something has a quality, it can't not have that quality at the same time.</p>

            <h3>Logic</h3>
            <p>He used logic to evaluate and validate reasoning. Aristotle had proven that reasoning is separate from
                the truthfulness of the premises being considered. A logical argument could have false premises and a
                true conclusion, but true premises would always lead to a true conclusion.</p>

            <h3>Ethics</h3>
            <p>Aristotle’s ethics do not deviate greatly from Plato’s in that they are agent-centered ethics, in which
                the moral agent determines the right moral action. Aristotle thought that no rules or appeal to
                consequences could possibly give a person correct guidelines in which to respond to all situations. in
                the early-modern period, more materialistic views of ethics began to compete with religious concepts,
                which where more popular at the time.
            </p>

            <h3>Eudemonia and Virtues</h3>
            <p>Aristotle thought that the goal of human beings in their search for happiness was to reach Eudemonia, or
                a state of flourishing. He agreed with Plato that virtue did not necessarily lead to a better life, but
                he did think that in order to achieve a true state of Eudemonia, aiming for virtue was necessary.
                Aristotle thought that the way to identify a virtue was that it was a middle ground between two vices in
                opposite directions. For instance, Temperance was identified by Aristotle as a virtue, and the very
                definition of this term implies taking things in moderation. While Virtue Ethics has come back in vogue,
                it is under contention what exactly key virtues are. Aristotle’s virtues are temperance, justice,
                fortitude, courage, liberality, magnificence, and magnanimity. Some philosophers might simply replace a
                term that they find too vague, such as justice, with a term they find more specific, like fairness.
                Others might insist on replacing certain virtues with entirely different ones.</p>
